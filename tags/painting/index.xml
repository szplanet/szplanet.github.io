      <description>Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already 2021 and we&amp;rsquo;ve been in pandemic mode for almost a year now. It had been a challenging year for many and a strange year for me as well, with many ups and downs. I had to adjust my life around it for quite a bit, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have family around and friends a phone call away (plus the weather in OC is superb).
