      <description>I love making things with my hands and cross-stitching has always been something that I wanted to try. During the past couple months, I had time to take a pause in the weekly travels, so I picked up a cross-stitching kit. As a “crazy cat lady”, I decided to go with this cat pattern. At the time of purchase, I thought to myself that I can totally knock this off in a couple days because it looked like a straightforward beginner level kit.</description>
