      <description>Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already 2021 and we&amp;rsquo;ve been in pandemic mode for almost a year now. It had been a challenging year for many and a strange year for me as well, with many ups and downs. I had to adjust my life around it for quite a bit, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have family around and friends a phone call away (plus the weather in OC is superb).
 &amp;ldquo;My 2020 was an X-Ray that revealed everything that I needed to work on and it showed me everything that was important to me.</description>

      <description>I love making things with my hands and cross-stitching has always been something that I wanted to try. During the past couple months, I had time to take a pause in the weekly travels, so I picked up a cross-stitching kit. As a “crazy cat lady”, I decided to go with this cat pattern. At the time of purchase, I thought to myself that I can totally knock this off in a couple days because it looked like a straightforward beginner level kit.</description>
