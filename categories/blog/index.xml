      <description>Problem You read a great book, highlighted your favorite quotes, but a few months later, you forgot most of the things in the book and never revisit the notes you took. Does that happen to you? Well, it happens to me all the time. I can vaguely remember the gist and my impressions of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read, and overtime, I return everything back to my &amp;ldquo;teachers&amp;rdquo;.
I used read a lot of random books, especially detective novels, as a kid until school/textbook reading occupied most of my time.</description>

      <description>Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already 2021 and we&amp;rsquo;ve been in pandemic mode for almost a year now. It had been a challenging year for many and a strange year for me as well, with many ups and downs. I had to adjust my life around it for quite a bit, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have family around and friends a phone call away (plus the weather in OC is superb).
 &amp;ldquo;My 2020 was an X-Ray that revealed everything that I needed to work on and it showed me everything that was important to me.</description>

      <description>This is a very light and fluffy cake recipe. Preparation time is 15 – 20 minutes and cook time is around 1 hour. The pictured cake was made using a 9” angle food cake pan, but the pan could be of any size and shape. I’m still experimenting and tweaking this recipe to get an optimal cake. Meanwhile, this one is pretty delicious, so enjoy! Ingredients For</description>

      <description>About Alexandria, VA Founded in 1749, Alexandria was a tobacco trading post and because of its unique location along the Potomac river, it was one of the busiest ports in America. Upon arrival at night, I was immediately drawn by the colonial style brick houses, walkable streets, and a variety of boutique shops and restaurants. Quaint is the word I would use – this is exactly what I envisioned a historic New England town would look like!</description>
